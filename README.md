I developed a simple workout tracking app for iOS for my schools cultural festival to present
to visitors to the classroom. The application starts by setting user information on set up,
determining goals such as weight loss or gain, and uses TDEE calculation to display a users
daily target calories.

Also asks for permissions to integrate iOS's native HealthKit to track and display daily steps
and daily active calories to be displayed on the homepage.

After set up is complete, using user defaults it saves data of tracked workouts segmented by day
using a calendar, and then organized by week. On individual workout explanation pages a graph
is automatically generated over time that shows progress regarding weight used (kg) in a given 
workout.
